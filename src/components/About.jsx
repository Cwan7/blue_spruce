The delivery and set up was fast, allowing us to get back to business in a flash. Further, instead of just handing us a manual and leaving, Dennis provided us with a personal and impressively detailed explanation of the printer's functions. We couldn't be happier with our new machine and look forward to working with Blue Spruce Concepts in the future.",

Dennis has set us up for guaranteed 100% uptime with their excellent service and support, and a back up production copier. These two copiers are also serve as printers on our network, and they also fax and scan all types of documents with ease. I highly recommend Blue Spruce Concepts to any company, and especially those that cannot tolerate any downtime on their copiers.",
